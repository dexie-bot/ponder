# Self-hosting [Host a Ponder app on your own infrastructure]

In general, hosting a Ponder app is similar to hosting a normal Node.js web server. This section describes the key Ponder-specific quirks to consider when self-hosting.

## Database connection

In production, Ponder works best with a Postgres database in the same private network. Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to the connection string of your Postgres database, or manually override the `database.connectionString` option in `ponder.config.ts`.

```ts [ponder.config.ts]
import { createConfig } from "ponder";

export default createConfig({
  database: {
    kind: "postgres",
    connectionString: "postgres://user:password@mycloud.internal:5432/database",
  },
  // ... more config
});
```

:::info
Your app will likely have performance issues if the roundtrip database latency
is greater than **50ms**. This is common when using a database in a different
private network or cloud region.

## Database schema

Each deployment must use a different database schema. Use the `DATABASE_SCHEMA` environment variable or the `--schema` CLI argument passed to `ponder start` to specify which database schema each deployment should use. [Read more](/docs/api-reference/database#database-schema-rules) about database schema selection rules.

The best choice depends on your deployment strategy. Here are a few common options.

- Kubernetes pod name
- Railway deployment ID
- Git branch name or commit hash

## Health checks & probes

Use the `/health` and `/ready` endpoints to configure health checks or [probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/liveness-readiness-startup-probes/).

- **`/health`**: Returns an HTTP `200` response immediately after the process starts.
- **`/ready`**: Returns an HTTP `200` response once indexing progress has reached realtime across all chains. During the historical backfill, the endpoint returns an HTTP `503` response.

## Crash recovery

If a Ponder app running `ponder start` crashes and restarts using the same database schema, it will attempt to resume indexing where it left off. [Read more](/docs/api-reference/database#build-id-and-crash-recovery) about the instance lifecycle and crash recovery mechanism.

## Advanced

### Scale the HTTP server

If a `ponder start` instance receives a large volume of HTTP traffic (e.g. GraphQL requests), the HTTP server will contend with the indexing engine for CPU and memory resources. This can lead to degraded indexing performance and might ultimately crash the instance.

To solve this problem, you can use `ponder serve` to run additional instances of the HTTP server without the indexing engine. Here are a few things to keep in mind.

- The `ponder serve` instance should use the same [database schema](#database-schema) as the `ponder start` instance that you'd like to scale.
- If one `ponder serve` instance is not enough, it's safe to run multiple replicas behind a proxy.

### Database maintenance

The `ponder db` CLI entrypoint offers a set of commands useful for observing and maintaining your database. [Read more](/docs/api-reference/ponder-cli#db).
