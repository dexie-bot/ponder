# Get started [An introduction to Ponder]

## What is Ponder?

Ponder is an open-source framework for custom Ethereum indexing.

You write TypeScript code to transform onchain data into your desired application schema. Then, you can query the data through GraphQL, SQL over HTTP, or directly in Postgres.

Ponder supports any Ethereum-compatible blockchain â€” all you need is an RPC URL.

## Quickstart

::::steps

### Run `create-ponder`

The `create-ponder` CLI tool quickly bootstraps a new Ponder project.

:::code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm create ponder
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn create ponder
```

```bash [npm]
npm init ponder@latest
```

:::

### Start the dev server

Start the local development server.

:::code-group

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm dev
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn dev
```

```bash [npm]
npm run dev
```

### Query the database

Next, visit [localhost:42069/graphql](http://localhost:42069/graphql) in your browser to explore the auto-generated GraphQL API. Here's a query for the top accounts by balance, along with the total number of accounts.

:::code-group

```graphql [Query]
query {
  accounts(orderBy: "balance", orderDirection: "desc", limit: 2) {
    items {
      address
      balance
    }
    totalCount
  }
}
```

```json [Result]
{
  "accounts": {
    "items": [
      { "address": "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890", "balance": "1000000000000000000" },
      { "address": "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567891", "balance": "900000000000000000" },
    ],
    "totalCount": 1726,
  }
}
```

### Customize the schema

### Customize indexing logic

That's it! Next, learn about how to run Ponder in production, the factory pattern,
