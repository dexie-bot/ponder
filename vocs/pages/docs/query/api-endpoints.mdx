# API endpoints [Customize the HTTP server]

Use API endpoints to write custom logic to serve web requests, with direct access to Ponder's database and other useful resources.

## Hono instance

Ponder's API server uses [Hono](https://hono.dev/), a fast and lightweight HTTP router.

The `src/api/index.ts` file **must** default export a Hono instance. To customize the server, register routes and middleware on the Hono instance before exporting it.

```ts [src/api/index.ts (minimal)]
import { Hono } from "hono";

const app = new Hono();

app.get("/hello", (c) => {
  return c.text("Hello, world!");
});

export default app;
```
