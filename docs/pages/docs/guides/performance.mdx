# Performance

Ponder is a powerful tool for building backends for crypto apps. It can scale to process hundreds of millions of events and backfill thousands of events per second.

In this guide we will explore the best practices for getting maximum performance for a Ponder app. 

[events per second and realtime latency charts]

### 1. Limit raw SQL

Sometimes the query builder API is not powerful enough. When this is the case, you can drop down to [raw SQL](/docs/indexing/write-to-the-database#raw-sql). However, this is significantly slower and should be used sparingly.

- unique constraints

```ts filename="src/index.ts"
```

- update where

```ts filename="src/index.ts"
```


### 2. Use simple primary keys

Ponder can benefit from predictable, simple primary keys that only use properties of `event`. 

```ts filename="src/index.ts"
```

Sometimes composite values are necessary to acheive the desired behavior. 

```ts filename="src/index.ts"
```

### 3. Move logic to "query" time

Ponder provides an expressive SQL client for querying an app over HTTP. This can be leveraged to remove expensive computation from indexing functions.

```ts filename="src/index.ts"
```

### 4. Limit RPC requests

### 5. Set `maxRequestsPerSecond`

Users can improve the performance of the initial sync by using a quality RPC provider with a high `maxRequestsPerSecond` for higher bandwidth.

  Be careful! Setting `maxRequestsPerSecond` too high can lead to 429 rate-limit responses.
</Callout>

```ts filename="ponder.config.ts" {9}
import { createConfig } from "ponder";
import { http } from "viem";

export default createConfig({
  networks: {    
    mainnet: {
      chainId: 1,      
      transport: http("https://rpc.com/..."),
      maxRequestsPerSecond: 250, 
    },  
  },  
  // ... more config
});
```

### 6. Use `ordering: "multichain"`

Use `ordering: "multichain"` to ignore ordering between chains, greatly improving latency.

```ts filename="ponder.config.ts" {4}
import { createConfig } from "ponder";

export default createConfig({
  ordering: "multichain",
  // ... more config
});
```
